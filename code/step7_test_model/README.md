Step 7: Model Evaluation
Purpose
Evaluates the trained SegFormer model from Step 6 on the test dataset using comprehensive metrics and generates detailed prediction visualizations. Provides final performance assessment with per-video and overall statistics for publication and analysis purposes.
Input Requirements
Trained Model: Best performing checkpoint from Step 6
•	output/output_step_06/segformer/<run>/best.pth - Optimal model weights
Test Dataset: output/output_step_05/test/
•	Original test set images and RGB segmentation masks (unchanged from original dataset)
Configuration File: config/step7_SFconfig.yaml
•	Model configuration, evaluation parameters, and output paths
Process Description
Model Inference:
1.	Loads best performing model from Step 6 training
2.	Processes all test set frames at original resolution
3.	Generates pixel-wise segmentation predictions for each frame
4.	Applies post-processing for optimal prediction quality
Comprehensive Evaluation:
1.	Computes per-class and overall performance metrics
2.	Calculates video-level statistics for detailed analysis
3.	Generates combined performance scores for benchmarking
Visualization Generation:
1.	Creates prediction overlay visualizations
2.	Generates comparison figures showing original, ground truth, prediction, and overlay
3.	Saves individual prediction masks for further analysis
Output
Results Directory: output/output_step_07/temp3sf/
Prediction Files:

└── <frame>_fig.png         # Comparison visualizations
                            # (Original | Ground Truth | Prediction | Overlay)
Performance Metrics:
•	metrics.csv - Comprehensive evaluation results with per-video and overall statistics
Metric Categories:
•	Per-Video Metrics: Individual video performance analysis
•	Per-Class Metrics: Class-specific segmentation quality
•	Overall Metrics: Dataset-wide performance summary
•	Combined Scores: Integrated mIoU, mNSD, and composite metrics
Usage Instructions
Execute evaluation from the project root directory:
D:\ProjectMach\.venv\Scripts\python.exe ^
  D:\ProjectMach\code\step7_test_model\step7_SFtest.py ^
  --config D:\ProjectMach\config\step7_SFconfig.yaml
Alternative with explicit paths:
python code/step7_test_model/step7_SFtest.py ^
  --config config/step7_SFconfig.yaml ^
  --model output/output_step_06/segformer/<run>/best.pth
Notes
•	Evaluation uses the original test set resolution for accurate performance assessment
•	All prediction visualizations include ground truth overlays for qualitative analysis
•	Metrics are computed using the same evaluation framework as training validation
•	Results are saved in CSV format for easy integration with analysis tools
•	Individual prediction masks can be used for further post-processing or ensemble methods
•	Performance metrics align with established surgical instrument segmentation benchmarks
